Hello, groupname!

The application is installed in C:\Program Files (x86)\Haverford College S-Chords\Email Sender\EmailSender
A shortcut should be created automatically, so if you type EmailSender into your windows search bar it should come up...

So, young S-Chord. It is time for tour. Oh baby. This app is your new best friend!

We S-Chords have historically made a point to personalize all of the emails we send so that groups know we care about them and really want to tour with them. But, as technology made itself available to us, we realized that we are perfectly happy sacrificing that genuine interest for time, and became perfectly happy just making sure that groups think we care about them.

And along came this application! Because Greg is a nerd.

Put whatever you want in this canvas!!! We support
colors
fun fonts!
hyperlinks
And even embedded images
Took me a little while to get that working. Just please make sure you copy an image from the internet, local copies will not work!

Right, so. Write your email, make tour with the s-chords sound awesome and inticing. Offer up promises of revalry and harmony, request a plot of sand to rest tired little s-heads. You can write right in here, or copy from another document. Word should work, google docs, an actual email client.

When you are happy with your email, direct your attention to the left!

1. Change email address if needed (if for some reason you are not sending from the normal gmail one)
2. Enter the password for the email address entered above
3. Provide a "substitution string", e.g. groupname. This is the word that will be substituted with the names of all of the groups you wish to send an email to guaranteeing automatic "personalness"
4. Set your subject, be cautious about overwriting the default... because TRADITION
5. Click Preview... This is a preview of exactly what the email will look like and all of the "substitution string"s substituted with the first group name in the group list. This is "'Ford S-Chords" by default.
6. Inspect your preview and make sure everything looks yummy, that you didn't accidentally write "gruopname" somewhere, or something.
7. Click Send Test ... This will send an email to YOUR email address---whatever email address you have put in the Email Address field. It will substitute the "substitution string" with "'Ford S-Chords"
8. Login to your email and inspect the email. Ensure that the yumminess is maintained.
9. You are now ready to create your group list! Add groups to the group list manually, by clicking on the cells in the empty row. Feel free to select the example S-Chord one and delete it, or leave it if you want to send messages to yourself. You can also load a group list from a CSV. Make sure it is of the format name;email;school (e.g. 'Ford S-Chords;haverfordschords@gmail.com;Haverford College).
NOTE that the fields are delimited by ; not , this is because some groups have commas in their names and escape characters are annoying to deal with. There should be a way to save an excel spreadsheet with semicolons instead of commas.
10. At any time you can highlight a group's row and click Preview, or hit Enter/Return on your keyboard, which will pop up a Preview of the email to be sent with their name substituted. 
11. Once you are happy with your email and have all of your groups in, click Send Emails! Watch the status message on the bottom right indicate success / failures. 


ASSUMPTIONS:
1. The email address you are using is on a google domain (this is true of all Haverford accounts as of 2/21/2020)
2. Less secure app access is TURNED ON for the email address you are using. If you are not sure, login to the gmail account and then navigate to https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps

All source code for this can be found at https://github.com/gavanaken/EmailSender
If things break, toss an issue request in there. But I probably won't be super active with this. I do have a day job.


Cheers, happy tour.
Xoxo,
